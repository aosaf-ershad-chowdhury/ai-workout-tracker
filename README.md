## Transform Your Workouts with Real-Time Form Analysis

FormFit is an AI-powered fitness coach that analyzes your exercise form in real-time using just your webcam. Get instant feedback on your technique to maximize gains and prevent injuries.

## Key Features ✨

- **Real-Time Form Analysis**: Get instant feedback on your exercise technique
- **Multi-Exercise Support**: Squats, pushups, lunges, and more
- **Rep Counting**: Automatic rep tracking with performance metrics
- **Injury Prevention**: Alerts for dangerous form mistakes
- **No Hardware Needed**: Works with any webcam - no sensors or wearables
- **Privacy-First**: All processing happens locally in your browser

## How It Works 🧠

FormFit uses cutting-edge computer vision technology to transform your device into a personal trainer:

1. **Capture**: Uses your webcam to record your workout
2. **Analyze**: MediaPipe Pose detects 33 skeletal landmarks in real-time
3. **Evaluate**: Proprietary algorithms assess joint angles and movement patterns
4. **Feedback**: Provides instant corrective guidance and performance metrics

## Challenges Overcome 🧗

Building FormFit presented exciting technical challenges:

1. **Cross-Device Compatibility**  
   Implemented responsive design that works on mobile and desktop

2. **Feedback Clarity**  
   Created intuitive visual and textual feedback systems

```typescript
// Example analysis algorithm
function analyzeSquat(landmarks: Landmark[]): string {
  const kneeAngle = calculateJointAngle(hip, knee, ankle);
     const backAngle = calculateJointAngle(shoulder, hip, knee);
     ...
     const avgDepth =
      depthHistory.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / depthHistory.length;
    const depthVariation =
      Math.max(...depthHistory) - Math.min(...depthHistory);
    ....
    const messages = [];
    if (depthVariation > 50) {
      messages.push("Maintain consistent depth between reps");
    }
    if (currentDepth < avgDepth - 10) {
      messages.push("You're not going as deep as previous reps");
    }
     if (avgKneeAngle > 100 && state.exercisePhase === "bottom") {
      messages.push("Go deeper! Aim for 90° knee bend");
    }
    ...
   }
```
